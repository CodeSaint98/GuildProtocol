The guild protocol aims to be an open-source freelancing forum. A third party
will be responsible for client and freelancer vetting as well as quality of work done via their platform. Fees can be accumulated by
third party to incentivize them to do this.
The callisto protocol aims to be a single token system that doesn't store funds of any kind. There will be no middlemen between client
and freelancer. 
A client may create a protocol with an appropriate bounty. Clients are incentivized to continue the contract via the Callisto protocol
but it is not mandatory.
A client pays through the single token. Freelancers can bid for free. A portion of what the client pays goes to those that invests in the
protocol liquidity pool.
This tier 1 of the system. Further upgrades should result in a more decentralized system that doesn't require users to part with their funds
in any way, shape or form unless they are paying for something.

Smart Contract Architecture:
1. Proposal smart contract:
    Client must have funds in the token equal to the bounty they put up. 
    Everytime client tries to create a new proposal must check if they have sufficient amounts of that token that is not locked into another proposal
    After a client locks in a freelancer to complete the project. In case the freelancer fails to meet expectations, the freelancer forfeits a bounty.
    Need to incentivize freelancer to provide a good project.
    Need to incentivize client to be truthful about status of project.
    Once the project is done with the client may close the bounty and payment is collected and transferred to freelancer in the same transaction.
2. Token: Token contract that is used between clients and freelancer. Each must be backed by a minimum amount.
